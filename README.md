&nbsp;

## Gears:

VidGear is built with multi-threaded **Gears** each with some unique function/mechanism. Each **Gear** is designed exclusively to handle/control different device-specific video streams, network streams, and media encoders. These APIs provides an easy-to-use, highly extensible, and a multi-threaded wrapper around many underlying various python libraries to exploit their features and functions directly while providing robust error-handling. 

**These Gears can be classified as follows:**

**A. VideoCapture Gears:**

  * [**CamGear:**](#camgear) _Targets various IP-USB-Cameras/Network-Streams/YouTube-Video-URL._
  * [**PiGear:**](#pigear) _Targets various Raspberry Pi Camera Modules._
  * [**ScreenGear:**](#screengear) _Enables ultra-fast Screen Casting._    
  * [**VideoGear:**](#videogear) _A common API with Video Stabilizer wrapper._  

**B. VideoWriter Gear:**

  * [**WriteGear:**](#writegear) _Handles easy Lossless Video Encoding and Compression._

**C. Network Gear:**

  * [**NetGear:**](#netgear) _Targets synchronous video frames transferring between interconnecting systems over the network._

&nbsp;

### CamGear

CamGear supports a diverse range of video streams which can handle/control video stream almost any IP/USB Cameras, multimedia video file format, network stream URL such as `http(s), rtp, rstp, mms, etc.` In addition to this, it also supports live Gstreamer's RAW pipelines and YouTube video/livestreams URLs. CamGear provides a flexible, high-level multi-threaded wrapper around `OpenCV's` [VideoCapture class](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html#a57c0e81e83e60f36c83027dc2a188e80) with access almost all of its available parameters and also employs `pafy's` APIs for live [YouTube streaming](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/wiki/CamGear-Class#2-camgear-class-with-live-youtube-piplineing-using-video-url). Furthermore, CamGear relies exclusively on [**Threaded Queue mode**](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/wiki/Threaded-Queue-Mode) for ultra-fast, error-free and synchronized frame handling.

&nbsp;

### VideoGear

VideoGear API provides a special internal wrapper around VidGear's exclusive [**Video Stabilizer**](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/wiki/Stabilizer-Class) class. Furthermore, VideoGear API can provide internal access to both [CamGear](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/wiki/CamGear)) and [PiGear](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/wiki/PiGear) APIs separated by a special flag. Thereby, _this API holds the exclusive power for any incoming VideoStream from any source, whether it is live or not, to stabilize it directly with minimum latency and memory requirements._

Code to generate above VideoGear API Stabilized Video(_See more detailed usage examples [here](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/wiki/Real-time-Video-Stabilization#usage)_): 

```python
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears import VideoGear
import numpy as np
import cv2

stream_stab = VideoGear(source='test.mp4', stabilize = True).start() # To open any valid video stream with `stabilize` flag set to True.
stream_org = VideoGear(source='test.mp4').start() # open same stream without stabilization for comparison

# infinite loop
while True:
  
  frame_stab = stream_stab.read()
  # read stabilized frames

  # check if frame is None
  if frame_stab is None:
    #if True break the infinite loop
    break
  
  #read original frame
  frame_org = stream_org.read()

  #concatenate both frames
  output_frame = np.concatenate((frame_org, frame_stab), axis=1)

  #put text
  cv2.putText(output_frame, "Before", (10, output_frame.shape[0] - 10),cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.6, (0,255,0), 2)
  cv2.putText(output_frame, "After", (output_frame.shape[1]//2+10, frame.shape[0] - 10),cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.6, (0,255,0), 2)
  
  cv2.imshow("Stabilized Frame", output_frame)
  # Show output window

  key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
  # check for 'q' key-press
  if key == ord("q"):
    #if 'q' key-pressed break out
    break

cv2.destroyAllWindows()
# close output window
stream_org.stop()
stream_stab.stop()
# safely close video streams.
```

### PiGear

PiGear is similar to CamGear but made to support various Raspberry Pi Camera Modules (such as [OmniVision OV5647 Camera Module](https://github.com/techyian/MMALSharp/wiki/OmniVision-OV5647-Camera-Module) and [Sony IMX219 Camera Module](https://github.com/techyian/MMALSharp/wiki/Sony-IMX219-Camera-Module)). To interface with these modules correctly, PiGear provide a flexible multi-threaded wrapper around complete [picamera](https://github.com/waveform80/picamera) python library, and provides us the ability to exploit its various features like `brightness, saturation, sensor_mode, etc.` effortlessly.

### ScreenGear

With ScreenGear, we can easily define an area on the computer screen or an open window to record the live screen frames in real-time at the expense of insignificant latency. To achieve this, ScreenGear provides a high-level multi-threaded wrapper around [**`mss`**](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss) python library API and also supports the flexible direct parameter manipulation. 

**Below is a snapshot of a ScreenGear API in action:**

<p align="center">

</p>

Code to generate above result:

```python
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears import ScreenGear
import cv2

stream = ScreenGear().start()

# infinite loop
while True:
  
  frame = stream.read()
  # read frames

  # check if frame is None
  if frame is None:
    #if True break the infinite loop
    break
  
  cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)
  # Show output window

  key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
  # check for 'q' key-press
  if key == ord("q"):
    #if 'q' key-pressed break out
    break

cv2.destroyAllWindows()
# close output window

stream.stop()
# safely close video stream.
```

### WriteGear

WriteGear is undoubtedly the most powerful Video Processing Gear of them all. It solely handles various powerful FFmpeg tools that allow us to do almost anything you can imagine with multimedia files. With WriteGear API, you can process real-time video frames into a lossless format and specification suitable for our playback in just a few lines of codes. These specifications include setting bitrate, codec, framerate, resolution, subtitles, compression, etc. Furthermore, we can multiplex extracted audio at the output with compression and all that in real-time(see this example). In addition to this, WriteGear also provides flexible access to OpenCV's VideoWriter API which provide some basic tools for video frames encoding but without compression.

**WriteGear primarily operates in the following two modes:**

  * **Compression Mode:** In this mode, WriteGear utilizes [**`FFmpeg's`**](https://ffmpeg.org/) inbuilt encoders to encode lossless multimedia files. It provides us the ability to exploit almost any available parameters available within FFmpeg, with so much ease and flexibility and while doing that it robustly handles all errors/warnings quietly. **You can find more about this mode [here](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/wiki/Compression-Mode:-FFmpeg)**.

  * **Non-Compression Mode:** In this mode, WriteGear utilizes basic OpenCV's inbuilt [**VideoWriter API**](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html). Similar to compression mode, WriteGear also supports all parameters manipulation available within OpenCV's VideoWriter API. But this mode lacks the ability to manipulate encoding parameters and other important features like video compression, audio encoding, etc. **You can learn about this mode [here](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/wiki/Non-Compression-Mode:-OpenCV)**.

[>>> Usage Guide](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/wiki/WriteGear#writegear-api)

&nbsp;

### NetGear

NetGear is exclusively designed to transfer video frames synchronously between interconnecting systems over the network in real-time. This is achieved by implementing a high-level wrapper around [PyZmQ](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq) python library that contains python bindings for [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) - a high-performance asynchronous distributed messaging library that aim to be used in distributed or concurrent applications.  It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ZeroMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker. Furthermore, NetGear currently supports two ZeroMQ messaging patterns: i.e `zmq.PAIR` and `zmq.REQ and zmq.REP`.

**NetGear API has two modes of operations:**
  * **Send Mode:**(a.k.a Server configuration) which employs `send()` function to send frames to the client(s). You can use this function to send messages to client(s) too.
  * **Receive Mode:**(a.k.a Client configuration) which employs `recv()` function to receive frames sent by server. Client send back confirmation when frame is received successfully.
