# Gears

> **VidGear is built with various **Multi-Threaded APIs** *(a.k.a Gears)* each with some unique function/mechanism.**

Each of these API is designed exclusively to handle/control different device-specific video streams, network streams, and media encoders. These APIs provides an easy-to-use, highly extensible, and a multi-threaded wrapper around various underlying libraries to exploit their features and functions directly while providing robust error-handling. 

**These Gears can be classified as follows:**

**A. VideoCapture Gears:**

  * [**CamGear:**](#camgear) _Targets various IP-USB-Cameras/Network-Streams/YouTube-Video-URL._
  * [**PiGear:**](#pigear) _Targets various Raspberry Pi Camera Modules._
  * [**ScreenGear:**](#screengear) _Enables ultra-fast Screen Casting._    
  * [**VideoGear:**](#videogear) _A common API with Video Stabilizer wrapper._  

**B. VideoWriter Gear:**

  * [**WriteGear:**](#writegear) _Handles easy Lossless Video Encoding and Compression._

**C. Network Gears:**

  * [**NetGear:**](#netgear) _Targets synchronous/asynchronous video frames transferring between interconnecting systems over the network._

  * [**WebGear:**](#webgear) _A powerful ASGI Video Server that transfers live video frames to any web browser on the network._

&nbsp;

## CamGear

> *CamGear can grab ultra-fast frames from diverse range of devices/streams, which includes almost any IP/USB Cameras, multimedia video file format ([_upto 4k tested_][test-4k]), various network stream protocols such as `http(s), rtp, rstp, rtmp, mms, etc.`, plus support for live Gstreamer's stream pipeline and YouTube video/livestreams URLs.*

CamGear provides a flexible, high-level multi-threaded wrapper around `OpenCV's` [VideoCapture class][opencv-vc] with access almost all of its available parameters and also employs [`pafy`][pafy] python APIs for live [YouTube streaming][youtube-wiki]. Furthermore, CamGear implements exclusively on [**Threaded Queue mode**][TQM-wiki] for ultra-fast, error-free and synchronized frame handling.


**Following simplified functional block diagram depicts CamGear API's generalized working:**

### CamGear API Guide:

[**>>> Usage Guide**][camgear-wiki]

&nbsp;

## VideoGear

> *VideoGear API provides a special internal wrapper around VidGear's exclusive [**Video Stabilizer**][stablizer-wiki] class.*

Furthermore, VideoGear API can provide internal access to both [CamGear](#camgear) and [PiGear](#pigear) APIs separated by a special flag. Thereby, _this API holds the exclusive power for any incoming VideoStream from any source, whether it is live or not, to access and stabilize it directly with minimum latency and memory requirements._

**Below is a snapshot of a VideoGear Stabilizer in action:**

</p>

Code to generate above VideoGear API Stabilized Video(_See more detailed usage examples [here][stablizer-wiki-ex]_): 

```python
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears import VideoGear
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Open any valid video stream with stabilization (`stabilize = True`)
stream_stab = VideoGear(source='test.mp4', stabilize = True).start()
# Open the same stream without stabilization for comparison
stream_org = VideoGear(source='test.mp4').start() 

# loop
while True:
  
  # read stabilized frame
  frame_stab = stream_stab.read()

  # check for NoneType
  if frame_stab is None: break
  
  #read original frame
  frame_org = stream_org.read()

  #concatenate both frames
  output_frame = np.concatenate((frame_org, frame_stab), axis=1)

  #Add text
  cv2.putText(output_frame, "Before", (10, output_frame.shape[0] - 10),cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.6, (0,255,0), 2)
  cv2.putText(output_frame, "After", (output_frame.shape[1]//2+10, frame.shape[0] - 10),cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.6, (0,255,0), 2)
  
  # Show output window
  cv2.imshow("Stabilized Frame", output_frame)

  # check for 'q' key-press
  key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
  if key == ord("q"): break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# safely close video streams.
stream_org.stop()
stream_stab.stop()
```

## PiGear

> *PiGear is similar to CamGear but made to support various Raspberry Pi Camera Modules *(such as [OmniVision OV5647 Camera Module][OV5647-picam] and [Sony IMX219 Camera Module][IMX219-picam])*.*

PiGear provides a flexible multi-threaded wrapper around complete [**picamera**][picamera] python library to interface with these modules correctly, and also grants the ability to exploit its various features like `brightness, saturation, sensor_mode, etc.` effortlessly. 

Best of all, PiGear API provides excellent Error-Handling with features like a threaded internal timer that keeps active track of any frozen threads and handles hardware failures/frozen threads robustly thereby will exit safely if any failure occurs. So now if you accidently pulled your camera module cable out when running PiGear API in your script, instead of going into possible kernel panic/frozen threads, API exit safely to save resources. 

**Following simplified functional block diagram depicts PiGear API:**

## ScreenGear

> *ScreenGear API act as Screen Recorder, that can grab frames from your monitor in real-time either by define an area on the computer screen or fullscreen at the expense of insignificant latency. It also provide seemless support for capturing frames from multiple monitors.*

ScreenGear provides a high-level multi-threaded wrapper around [**python-mss**][mss] python library API and also supports a easy and flexible direct internal parameter manipulation. 

**Below is a snapshot of a ScreenGear API in action:**

<p align="center">

Code to generate the above result:

```python
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears import ScreenGear
import cv2

#initiate stream
stream = ScreenGear().start()

# loop
while True:
  
  # read frames
  frame = stream.read()

  # check for NoneType
  if frame is None: break
  
  # Show output window
  cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)

  # check for 'q' key-press
  key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
  if key == ord("q"): break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

stream.stop()
# safely close video stream.
```

## WriteGear

> *WriteGear handles various powerful Writer Tools that provide us the freedom to do almost anything imagine with multimedia files.*

WriteGear API provide a complete, flexible & robust wrapper around [**FFmpeg**][ffmpeg], a leading multimedia framework. With WriteGear, we can process real-time video frames into a lossless compressed format with any suitable specification in just few easy [lines of codes][compression-mode-ex]. These specifications include setting any video/audio property such as `bitrate, codec, framerate, resolution, subtitles,  etc.` easily as well complex tasks such as multiplexing video with audio in real-time(see this [example wiki][live-audio-wiki]). Best of all, WriteGear grants the freedom to play with any FFmpeg parameter with its exclusive custom Command function(see this [example wiki][custom-command-wiki]), while handling all errors robustly. 

In addition to this, WriteGear also provides flexible access to [**OpenCV's VideoWriter API**][opencv-writer] which provides some basic tools for video frames encoding but without compression.

**WriteGear primarily operates in the following two modes:**

  * **Compression Mode:** In this mode, WriteGear utilizes [**`FFmpeg's`**][ffmpeg] inbuilt encoders to encode lossless multimedia files. It provides us the ability to exploit almost any available parameters available within FFmpeg, with so much ease and flexibility and while doing that it robustly handles all errors/warnings quietly. **You can find more about this mode [here][cm-writegear-wiki]**.

  * **Non-Compression Mode:** In this mode, WriteGear utilizes basic OpenCV's inbuilt [**VideoWriter API**][opencv-vw]. Similar to compression mode, WriteGear also supports all parameters manipulation available within OpenCV's VideoWriter API. But this mode lacks the ability to manipulate encoding parameters and other important features like video compression, audio encoding, etc. **You can learn about this mode [here][ncm-writegear-wiki]**.

**Following functional block diagram depicts WriteGear API's generalized working:**

## NetGear

> *NetGear is exclusively designed to transfer video frames synchronously and asynchronously between interconnecting systems over the network in real-time.*

NetGear implements a high-level wrapper around [**PyZmQ**][pyzmq] python library that contains python bindings for [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) - a high-performance asynchronous distributed messaging library that aim to be used in distributed or concurrent applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ZeroMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker. 

NetGear provides seamless support for bidirectional data transmission between receiver(client) and sender(server) through bi-directional synchronous messaging patterns such as zmq.PAIR _(ZMQ Pair Pattern)_ & zmq.REQ/zmq.REP _(ZMQ Request/Reply Pattern)_. 

NetGear also supports real-time frame Encoding/Decoding compression capabilities for optimizing performance while sending the frames directly over the network, by encoding the frame before sending it and decoding it on the client's end automatically in real-time. 

For security, NetGear implements easy access to ZeroMQ's powerful, smart & secure Security Layers, that enables strong encryption on data, and unbreakable authentication between the Server and the Client with the help of custom certificates/keys and brings easy, standardized privacy and authentication for distributed systems over the network. 

Best of all, NetGear can robustly handle Multiple Servers devices at once, thereby providing access to seamless Live Streaming of the multiple device in a network at the same time.


**NetGear as of now seamlessly supports three ZeroMQ messaging patterns:**

* [**`zmq.PAIR`**][zmq-pair] _(ZMQ Pair Pattern)_ 
* [**`zmq.REQ/zmq.REP`**][zmq-req-rep] _(ZMQ Request/Reply Pattern)_
* [**`zmq.PUB/zmq.SUB`**][zmq-pub-sub] _(ZMQ Publish/Subscribe Pattern)_

## WebGear

> *WebGear is a powerful ASGI Video Streamer API, that transfers live video frames to any web browser on the network in real-time.*

WebGear API provides a flexible abtract asyncio wrapper around [Starlette][starlette] ASGI library and easy access to its various components independently. Thereby implementing the ability to flexibly interact with the Starlette's ecosystem of shared middleware and mountable applications & seamless access to its various Response classes, Routing tables, Static Files, Templating engine(with Jinja2), etc.

WebGear can acts as robust _Live Video Streaming Server_ that can stream live video frames to any web browser on a network in real-time. It also auto-generates necessary data files for its default template and provides us the freedom to easily alter its [_performance parameters and routing tables_][advanced-webgear-wiki] according to our applications while handling errors robustly.


In addition to this, WebGear provides a special internal wrapper around VideoGear API, which itself provides internal access to both CamGear and PiGear APIs thereby granting it exclusive power for streaming frames incoming from any device/source. Also on the plus side, since WebGear has access to all functions of VideoGear API, therefore it can stabilize video frames even while streaming live.

**Below is a snapshot of a WebGear Video Server in action on Mozilla Firefox browser:**

from vidgear.gears import WebGear

#various performance tweaks
options = {"frame_size_reduction": 35, "frame_jpeg_quality": 90, "frame_jpeg_optimize": True}

#initialize WebGear app  
web = WebGear(source = "test.mp4", logging = True, **options)
#run this app on Uvicorn server at address http//0.0.0.0:8000/
uvicorn.run(web(), host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)

#close app safely
