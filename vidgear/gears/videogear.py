class VideoGear:

	"""
	VideoGear API provides a special internal wrapper around VidGear's exclusive Video Stabilizer class. Furthermore, VideoGear API can provide 
	internal access to both CamGear and PiGear APIs separated by a special flag. Thereby, this API holds the exclusive power for any incoming 
	VideoStream from any source, whether it is live or not, to stabilize it directly with minimum latency and memory requirements.

	VideoGear Specific parameters:
	
		:param (boolean) enablePiCamera: set this flag to access PiGear or CamGear class respectively. 
										/ This means the if enablePiCamera flag is `True`, PiGear class will be accessed 
										/ and if `False`, the camGear Class will be accessed. Its default value is False.

		:param (boolean) stabilize: set this flag to enable access to VidGear's Stabilizer Class. This basically enables(if True) or disables(if False) 
										video stabilization in VidGear. Its default value is False.

		:param (dict) **options: can be used in addition, to pass parameter supported by VidGear's stabilizer class.
								/ Supported dict keys are: 
									- `SMOOTHING_RADIUS` (int) : to alter averaging window size. It handles the quality of stabilization at expense of latency and sudden panning. 
															/ Larger its value, less will be panning, more will be latency and vice-versa. It's default value is 25.
									- `BORDER_SIZE` (int) : to alter output border cropping. It's will crops the border to reduce the black borders from stabilization being too noticeable. 
															/ Larger its value, more will be cropping. It's default value is 0 (i.e. no cropping).			
									- `BORDER_TYPE` (string) : to change the border mode. Valid border types are 'black', 'reflect', 'reflect_101', 'replicate' and 'wrap'. It's default value is 'black'
		
		:param (boolean) logging: set this flag to enable/disable error logging essential for debugging. Its default value is False.
	
	CamGear Specific supported parameters for VideoGear:

		:param source : take the source value for CamGear Class. Its default value is 0. Valid Inputs are:
			- Index(integer): Valid index of the video device.
			- YouTube Url(string): Youtube URL as input.
			- Network_Stream_Address(string): Incoming Stream Valid Network address. 
			- GStreamer (string) videostream Support
		:param (boolean) y_tube: enables YouTube Mode in CamGear Class, i.e If enabled the class will interpret the given source string as YouTube URL. 
								/ Its default value is False.
		:param (int) backend: set the backend of the video stream (if specified). Its default value is 0.


	PiGear Specific supported parameters for VideoGear:
	
		:param (tuple) resolution: sets the resolution (width,height) in Picamera class. Its default value is (640,480).
		:param (integer) framerate: sets the framerate in Picamera class. Its default value is 25.


	Common parameters for CamGear and PiGear: 
		:param (dict) **options: sets parameter supported by PiCamera or Camgear (whichever being accessed) Class to the input video stream. 
								/ These attribute provides the flexibity to manuplate input raspicam video stream directly. 
								/ Parameters can be passed using this **option, allows you to pass keyworded variable length of arguments to given Class.
		:param (boolean) logging: set this flag to enable/disable error logging essential for debugging. Its default value is False.
		:param (integer) time_delay: sets time delay(in seconds) before start reading the frames. 
							/ This delay is essentially required for camera to warm-up. 
							/ Its default value is 0.
