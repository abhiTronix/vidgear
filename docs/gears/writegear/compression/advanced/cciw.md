# Custom FFmpeg Commands in WriteGear API

WriteGear API now provides the **[`execute_ffmpeg_cmd`](/bonus/reference/writegear/#vidgear.gears.writegear.WriteGear.execute_ffmpeg_cmd) Function** in [Compression Mode](/gears/writegear/compression/overview/), that enables the user to pass any custom Terminal command _(that works on the terminal)_ as an input to its internal FFmpeg Pipeline by formating it as a list. 

This opens endless possibilities of exploiting every FFmpeg params within WriteGear without relying on a third-party API to do the same and while doing that it robustly handles all errors/warnings quietly. A user can now pass any custom Terminal command _(that works on the terminal)_ directly to the WriteGear's FFmpeg pipeline by formating it as a list.

&nbsp;


!!! warning "Important Information"

    * This Feature Requires WriteGear's [Compression Mode enabled(`compression_mode = True`)](/gears/writegear/compression/params/#compression_mode). Follow these dedicated [Installation Instructions ➶](/gears/writegear/compression/advanced/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

    * Only python **`list`** is a valid datatype as input value by this function, otherwise it will throw `ValueError`.

    * Kindly read [**FFmpeg Docs**](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) carefully, before passing any values to `output_param` dictionary parameter. Wrong values may result in undesired Errors or no output at all.

&nbsp;

## Features

- [x] Provides the ability to pass any custom command to WriteGear FFmpeg Pipeline.

- [x] Compatible with any FFmpeg terminal command.

- [x] Standalone On-the-fly functioning.

- [x] Can work without interfering with WriteGear API's Writer pipeline.

- [x] Minimum hassle and extremely easy to enable and use.

## Methods

### **[`execute_ffmpeg_cmd`](/bonus/reference/writegear/#vidgear.gears.writegear.WriteGear.execute_ffmpeg_cmd)** 

This method allows the users to pass the custom FFmpeg terminal commands as a _**formatted list**_ directly to WriteGear API's FFmpeg pipeline for processing/execution. Its usage is as follows: 
  
```python
#format FFmpeg terminal command `ffmpeg -y -i source_video -acodec copy input_audio.aac` as a list
ffmpeg_command = ['-y', '-i', source_video, '-acodec', 'copy', 'input_audio.aac']

#execute this list using this function
execute_ffmpeg_cmd(ffmpeg_command)
```


&nbsp;


## Usage Examples

!!! danger "User Discretion Advised"
  
    Following usage examples is just an idea of what can be done with this powerful function. So just Tinker with various FFmpeg parameters/commands yourself and see it working. Also, if you're unable to run any terminal FFmpeg command, then [report an issue](/contribution/issue/).


### Using WriteGear to separate Audio from Video

In this example, we will extract and save audio from a URL stream:

```python
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import WriteGear

#define a valid url
url_to_stream = 'http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4'

# Define writer with default parameters
writer = WriteGear(output_filename = 'Output.mp4', logging = True)  

#format command to convert stream audio as 'output_audio.aac' as list
ffmpeg_command_to_save_audio = ['-y', '-i', url_to_stream, 'output_audio.aac'] # `-y` parameter is to overwrite outputfile if exists

#execute FFmpeg command
writer.execute_ffmpeg_cmd(ffmpeg_command_to_save_audio)

# safely close writer
writer.close()
```

After running this script, You will get the final `'output_audio.aac'` audio file.

&nbsp;

### Using WriteGear to merge Audio with Video

In this example, we will merge audio with video:


!!! warning "Example Assumptions"

    * You already have a separate video(i.e `'input-video.mp4'`) and audio(i.e `'input-audio.aac'`) files.

    * Both these Audio and Video files are of equal duration.

```python
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import VideoGear
from vidgear.gears import WriteGear
import cv2
import time

#Open input video stream
stream = VideoGear(source='input-video.mp4').start()

#set input audio stream path 
input_audio = "input-audio.aac"

#define your parameters
output_params = {"-input_framerate":stream.framerate} #output framerate must match source framerate

# Define writer with defined parameters and suitable output filename for e.g. `Output.mp4`
writer = WriteGear(output_filename = 'Output.mp4', **output_params)

# loop over
while True:

    # read frames from stream
    frame = stream.read()

    # check for frame if Nonetype
    if frame is None:
        break


    # {do something with the frame here}


    # write frame to writer
    writer.write(frame)

    # Show output window
    cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)

    # check for 'q' key if pressed
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord("q"):
        break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# safely close video stream
stream.stop()

# safely close writer
writer.close()


#sleep 1 sec as the above video might still be rendering
time.sleep(1)


#format FFmpeg command to generate `Output_with_audio.mp4` by merging input_audio in above rendered `Output.mp4` 
ffmpeg_command = ['-y', '-i', 'Output.mp4', '-i', input_audio, '-c:v', 'copy', '-c:a', 'copy', '-map', '0:v:0', '-map', '1:a:0', '-shortest', 'Output_with_audio.mp4'] # `-y` parameter is to overwrite outputfile if exists

#execute FFmpeg command
writer.execute_ffmpeg_cmd(ffmpeg_command)

```

After running this script, You will get the final `'Output_with_audio.mp4'` file with both video and audio merged.
