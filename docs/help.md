## :fontawesome-solid-gift: Helping Author

> Donations help keep VidGear's development alive and motivate me _(as author)_. :heart:{ .heart }

It is something I am doing with my own free time. But so much more needs to be done, and I need your help to do this. For just the price of a cup of coffee 🍵, you can make a difference 🤝
