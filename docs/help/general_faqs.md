# General FAQs


&nbsp;


## "I'm new to Python Programming or its usage in OpenCV Library", How to use vidgear in my projects?

**Answer:** Before using vidgear, It's recommended to first go through the following dedicated blog sites and learn how OpenCV-Python syntax works _(with examples)_:

- [**PyImageSearch.com** ➶](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) is the best resource for learning OpenCV and its Python implementation. Adrian Rosebrock provides many practical OpenCV techniques with tutorials, code examples, blogs, and books at PyImageSearch.com. Highly recommended!

- [**learnopencv.com** ➶](https://www.learnopencv.com)  Maintained by OpenCV CEO Satya Mallick. This blog is for programmers, hackers, engineers, scientists, students, and self-starters interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

- There's also the official [**OpenCV Tutorials** ➶](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) curated by the OpenCV developers.

Once done, visit [Switching from OpenCV ➶](../../switch_from_cv/) to easily replace OpenCV APIs with suitable [Gears ➶](../../gears/#gears-what-are-these) in your project. All the best! :smiley:

!!! tip "If you run into any trouble or have any questions, then refer our [**Help**](../get_help) section."

## "VidGear is using Multi-threading, but Python is notorious for its poor performance in multithreading?"

**Answer:** Refer vidgear's [Threaded-Queue-Mode ➶](../../bonus/TQM/)

&nbsp;

## ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vidgear.gears'. 'vidgear' is not a package?

**Answer:** This error means you either have a file named `vidgear.py` in your python path or you've named your python script `vidgear.py`. Replace `vidgear` name with anything else to fix this error.

## How to log to a file in VidGear?

**Answer:** VidGear provides exclusive **`VIDGEAR_LOGFILE`** environment variable to enable logging to a file while logging is enabled _(i.e. `logging=True`)_ on respective Gear. You just have to set ==directory pathname _(automatically creates `vidgear.log` file)_== or a ==log file pathname== itself as value for this  environment variable. This can be done on various platforms/OSes as follows:

!!! info "Remember enabling this logging to a file will completely disable any output on the terminal." 

=== "Linux OS"

	```sh
	# path to file
	export VIDGEAR_LOGFILE="$HOME/foo.log"

	# or just directory path 
	# !!! Make sure `foo` path already exists !!!
	export VIDGEAR_LOGFILE="$HOME/foo"

	# to remove
	unset VIDGEAR_LOGFILE
	```

=== "Windows OS (Powershell)"

	```powershell
	# path to file
	$Env:VIDGEAR_LOGFILE = "D:\foo.log"

	# or just directory path 
	# !!! Make sure `foo` path already exists !!!
	$Env:VIDGEAR_LOGFILE = "D:\foo"

	# to remove
	$Env:VIDGEAR_LOGFILE = ""
	```

=== "OSX/Mac OS"
	
	```sh
	# path to file
	export VIDGEAR_LOGFILE="$HOME/foo.log"
	
	# or just directory path 
	# !!! Make sure `foo` path already exists !!!
	export VIDGEAR_LOGFILE="$HOME/foo"

	# to remove
	unset VIDGEAR_LOGFILE
	```

## Can I perform Deep Learning task with VidGear?

**Answer:** VidGear is a powerful Video Processing library _(similar to OpenCV, FFmpeg, etc.)_ that can read, write, process, send & receive a sequence of video-frames in an optimized manner. But for Deep Learning or Machine Learning tasks, you have to use a third-party library. That being said, all VidGear's APIs can be used with any third-party Library(such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.) that can leverage the overall performance if you're processing video/audio streams/frames in your application with Deep Learning tasks. Also, it eases the workflow since you have to write way fewer lines of code to read/store/process output videos.
