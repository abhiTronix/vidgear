# Stabilizer Class Examples

&nbsp;

## Saving Stabilizer Class output with Live Audio Input

In this example code, we will merging the audio from a Audio Device _(for e.g. Webcam inbuilt mic input)_ with Stablized frames incoming from the Stabilizer Class _(which is also using same Webcam video input through OpenCV)_, and save the final output as a compressed video file, all in real time:

??? new "New in v0.2.2" 
    This example was added in `v0.2.2`.

!!! alert "Example Assumptions"

    * You're running are Linux machine.
    * You already have appropriate audio driver and software installed on your machine.

    === "On Windows"

        Windows OS users can use the [dshow](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/DirectShow) (DirectShow) to list audio input device which is the preferred option for Windows users. You can refer following steps to identify and specify your sound card:

        - [x] **[OPTIONAL] Enable sound card(if disabled):** First enable your Stereo Mix by opening the "Sound" window and select the "Recording" tab, then right click on the window and select "Show Disabled Devices" to toggle the Stereo Mix device visibility. **Follow this [post ➶](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/no-sound-through-stereo-mix-realtek-hd-audio.1716182/) for more details.**

        - [x] **Identify Sound Card:** Then, You can locate your soundcard using `dshow` as follows:

            ```sh
            c:\> ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy
            ffmpeg version N-45279-g6b86dd5... --enable-runtime-cpudetect

        - [x] **Specify Sound Card:** Then, you can specify your located soundcard in StreamGear as follows:

            ```python
            # assign appropriate input audio-source
            output_params = {
                "-f": "dshow", # !!! warning: always keep this line above "-i" parameter !!!

    === "On Linux"

        Linux OS users can use the [alsa](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#alsa) to list input device to capture live audio input such as from a webcam. You can refer following steps to identify and specify your sound card:

        - [x] **Identify Sound Card:** To get the list of all installed cards on your machine, you can type `arecord -l` or `arecord -L` _(longer output)_.

            ```sh
            arecord -l

    === "On MacOS"

        MAC OS users can use the [avfoundation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devices.html#avfoundation) to list input devices for grabbing audio from integrated iSight cameras as well as cameras connected via USB or FireWire.
